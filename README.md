Backend project. 

# Project Title

### PennyWyser

## General Information

This is my final Back End Capstone project with NSS. The app is designed to simplfiy the event search process by focusing on only one search filter/ paremeter, cost.

Final MVP Approval May 16th.

## Purpose 

I wrote this app because in my life I have been in both situations. As a student I hated to ask for the daily agenda or to ask the instructor to repeat themselves. And as a manager/instructor I found that there is an incredible amount of time wasted on reptetive tasks like these.
