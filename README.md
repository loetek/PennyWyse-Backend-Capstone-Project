# Project Title

### PennyWyser

## General Information

This is my final Back End Capstone project with NSS. The app is designed to simplfiy the event search process by focusing on only one search filter/ paremeter, cost.

Final MVP Approval May 16th.

## Purpose 

There are many applications and organazations that focus on different methods for event search I wanted to pair down the process to it's most basic form and only use price as a determining factor. The application is written in C# ASP .NET all the data is seeded via a migration and I used entity framework for scaffolding and relational mapping.
